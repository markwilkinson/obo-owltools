comment: The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

A gene product may be located in one or more parts of a cell and its location may be as specific as a particular macromolecular complex, that is, a stable, persistent association of macromolecules that function together." [GOC:go_curators]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

Gene products from a multi-cellular organism that are secreted from a cell into the interstitial fluid or blood can therefore be annotated to this term.

name: Golgi apparatus
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions." [ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.

def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

def: "The regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times."

comment: Note that this term and its child terms are intended for receptors that are directly coupled to a signal transduction pathway. This term should therefore not be used to annotate decoy receptors and other proteins that bind a signal but do not pass the signal on. This term can be used to annotate dependence receptors that transduce a signal when a ligand is withdrawn (in this case, signal withdrawal is considered to be the initiating signal), or receptors that signal at a basal level in the absence of a bound agonist. For receptors that mediate transport of a substance into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, consider instead the term 'cargo receptor activity ; GO:0038024' and its children.

name: transcription regulatory region DNA binding

def: "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a DNA region that regulates the transcription of a region of DNA, which may be a gene, cistron, or operon. Binding may occur as a sequence specific interaction or as an interaction observed only once a factor has been recruited to the DNA by other factors." [GOC:jl, GOC:txnOH, SO:0005836]
comment: The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

comment: This relation is currently used to connect two regulation processes p1 and p2, such that if r1 regulates p1 and r2 regulates p2, and r1 results_in r2 then the regulation of p1 is required for the regulation of p2. For an example of use, see GO:0035958 'regulation of glyoxylate cycle by regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter'. Note that a precise definition of this relation is under discussion. After it has been formalized it will be added to RO, where it will have a RO ID. Note that the existing identifier and label are subject to change.
