comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

comment: Transmembrane transport requires transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children.
