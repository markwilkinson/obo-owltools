remark: The contents of this document are valid obo-format.
remark: However, they contain a mixture of bad practice and patterns that are discouraged within certain ontologies.
remark: Oort should provide a list of warnings by default. It should also be configurable such that it fails if certain types of check are violated.

[Term]
id: X:1
comment: term has no name! This is valid obo format, but Oort should by default ensure that every term has a name

[Term]
id: X:2
name: obsolete test
is_obsolete: true
is_a: X:1
comment: obsolete classes should have no logical axioms. this is an obo-format structure violation

[Term]
id: X:2b
name: obsolete ref test
is_a: X:2
comment: no longical axiom should ever point to an obsolete class

[Term]
id: X:3
name: non-existent relation
relationship: non_existent_relation X:1
comment: Optionally Oort should check all relations used should be declared (no dangling relations)

[Term]
id: X:4
name: dangling
relationship: part_of NONEXISTENT:1
comment: Optionally Oort should check there are no dangling classes in the release file (apart from no-src)

[Term]
id: X:5
name: isa-orphan
relationship: part_of X:1
comment: Optionally Oort should check that every class that has some logical axiom has a named superclass (i.e. must have is_a or intersection_of tags)

name: dual-genus
intersection_of: X:1
intersection_of: X:4
comment: Valid obo-format, but a discouraged pattern for obo-format ontologies

comment: optionally Oort should check all relations declared are used in some axiom

comment: This relation is not used itself, but forms a clique of relations. Only cliques of 1 are discouraged.
